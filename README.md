## Development

This theme uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The Tailwind configuration file is located at `themes/lms/tailwind.config.js`.

### Features in Detail

#### Newsletter Subscription
The theme includes a newsletter subscription form in the footer that you can integrate with your preferred email service provider. The form is styled with Tailwind CSS and includes:
- Email input field
- Subscribe button
- Custom success/error messages

### Newsletter Integration

The theme supports custom newsletter integration through the `params.newsletter.customCode` parameter. You can paste any HTML/JS code from your newsletter service provider (like Mailchimp, ConvertKit, etc.) to replace the default form.

To use a custom newsletter form:

1. Get the embed code from your newsletter service (e.g., Mailchimp, ConvertKit)
2. Open your site's `config.toml` file
3. Add your custom form code under the newsletter section:
   ```toml
   [params.newsletter]
     enabled = true
     customCode = '''
     <!-- Replace this with your form code -->
     <form action="https://your-form-endpoint.com" method="post" class="space-y-3">
       <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your email" class="w-full px-4 py-2 rounded">
       <button type="submit" class="w-full px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded">Subscribe</button>
     </form>
     '''
   ```

Example with Mailchimp:
```toml
[params.newsletter]
  enabled = true
  customCode = '''
  <!-- Replace with your Mailchimp form code -->
  <div id="mc_embed_signup">
    <form action="https://your-account.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=XXXXX&amp;id=XXXXX" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" class="validate" target="_blank">
      <div id="mc_embed_signup_scroll">
        <div class="mc-field-group">
          <input type="email" name="EMAIL" class="required email w-full px-4 py-2 border rounded" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Enter your email">
        </div>
        <div class="clear">
          <button type="submit" class="w-full mt-3 px-4 py-2 bg-primary-600 text-white rounded">Subscribe</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </form>
  </div>
  '''
```

Note: The custom form code will completely replace the default form. You can use Tailwind CSS classes to style your custom form to match the theme's design.
