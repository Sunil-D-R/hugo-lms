```bash
hugo new courses/my-course.md
```

2. Add categories and tags to your course front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "My Course Title"
date: 2024-01-01
categories: ["Web Development", "JavaScript"]
tags: ["frontend", "react"]
difficulty: "intermediate"

## Development

This theme uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The Tailwind configuration file is located at `themes/lms/tailwind.config.js`.

### Features in Detail

#### Newsletter Subscription
The theme includes a newsletter subscription form in the footer that you can integrate with your preferred email service provider. The form is styled with Tailwind CSS and includes:
- Email input field
- Subscribe button
- Custom success/error messages

### Newsletter Integration

The theme supports custom newsletter integration through the `params.newsletter.customCode` parameter. You can paste any HTML/JS code from your newsletter service provider (like Mailchimp, ConvertKit, etc.) to replace the default form.

To use a custom newsletter form:

1. Get the embed code from your newsletter service
2. Add it to your `config.toml`:
   ```toml
   [params.newsletter]
     enabled = true
     customCode = '''
     <!-- Your newsletter embed code here -->
     '''
   ```

If `customCode` is empty, the theme will use its default form styling.

#### Course Navigation
- Clean and intuitive course navigation
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Quick access to course materials

#### About Page
The theme includes a styled about page template that supports:
- Team member profiles with images
- Mission statement
- Platform features
- Contact information
